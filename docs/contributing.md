## How can I help the project?

You do not need to be a developer to contribute. There are multiple ways to help our project:

- [Donations](https://github.com/users/akyoto/sponsorship)
- [Pull Requests](https://github.com/animenotifier/notify.moe/pulls)

## How do I make a proper pull request?

- Fork the project on GitHub
- Create a new branch
- Upload the changes to your branch
- Check the [style guidelines](https://github.com/akyoto/quality/blob/master/STYLE.md)
- Create a pull request

## What if I already made a pull request but want to add more commits?

If you correctly created a new branch for your changes, you can simply upload the new commits to your fork and they will automatically appear in the PR.
